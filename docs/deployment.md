# Setting up an imok server in the real world

## Thinking about security

Imok, to the best of our knowledge, is completely legal in the UK and you are well within your rights to run and operate and instance of it for any purpose you like. However, with the current 'hostile environment' and the rise of the far right, it's wise to take security precautions to ensure the safety of everyone involved.

The three main threats to your instance that imok have been designed with in mind are:

1. Attempts to hack into the server to dox vulnerable people by the far right.
2. Seizure of the server by the police or security services to get a list of users.
3. Infiltration of your group by either of the above to get the same information.

We believe that in all cases there are _far_ easier ways to get this information than imok, which fundamentally holds almost no data for the amount of effort this would take. However, here's some tips that we highly recommend you read and absorb before proceeding with a full rollout.

1. Have as few people as possible -- preferably exactly one -- with actual server access.
1. Have as few people as possible -- preferably no more than two -- with access to the admin interface.
1. Ensure every administrator has at a minimum a five digit security password on their phone. Fingerprints have been coerced in at least one case, and patterns are easy to guess.
1. Enable 'disappearing messages' on the admin Telegram group.
1. Telegram invite links work until they are cancelled. Revoke the invite link for the admin group whenever you can.
1. If possible set up your server in a country with good privacy laws. We recommend Iceland or Switzerland. Anywhere that's not the UK is great though -- just make it a hassle.
1. SMS is provided as a fallback but you should be aware that SMS messages can be intercepted, that every SMS will be very easy to trace, and that they can be spoofed by security services to create a false 'out' message. Obviously it is highly unlikely that these will be serious concerns in almost all instances.

## Running the pilot

Who is keeping track of it?
Runbook - documentation for if it breaks
Server updates / security / airbrake details
SLA - acceptable downtime?

## Signup protocol

1. In person at a signing centre
1. Through groups
1. Via a press release

1. Asylum seeker contacts a listed phonenumber for No Borders
1. Admin adds them to the system: Guy & Maddie
